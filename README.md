#Arduino Training

This project repository is my playground when I am playing around with  my [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) kit.

Each folder in this repository will contain one minor project and hopefully I will have time to many projects with my Arduino.

##Requirements
My Arduino kit consists of one Arduino Uno, one breadboard and some electronic components.

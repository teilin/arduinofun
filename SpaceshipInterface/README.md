#Spaceship interface

This minor project did I get from the book that was in the Arduino starter kit box.

The point is to create a cirkit that contain three leds, one button and some resistors. When the program is loaded, one of the leds (a green one in my case) will light. The two red leds will be off. When the button is pressed, the green led will turn off and the red leds will blink.
